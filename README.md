# 101 Presentations

I gave a lot of feedback to student presentations during my time working at the university but also later, whenever I had the chance in my professional environment. A lot of the feedback contained similar topics, so recently I decided to start writing it down in this "open for edits" repository. Feel free to drop a pull request including a change or additional content.

## Content

### Structure

### Presentations in Academia

#### Your contribution

### Slides (Structure/General)

#### The 10/20/30 Rule

#### Pace: I am faster than 2 minutes per slide!

#### Just to impress the audience slide

- With every equation on a slide you lose half of your audience
- to show off, you need one complicated slide to proof that you know the topic very well
- you should be able to explain it though!
- especially in academia this is crucial
- comes in handy in case you run out of time or have too much time left

#### Backup slides

- instead of deleting slides, move it after the last slide
- use backup slides for answering questions and look impress with your preparation ;)
- use backup slides when you finish a way too early

#### Forget the Thank You slide

- people have to sit there or want to sit there
- 10min staring on one slide, and yu want to say thank you
- use it "take away message", summary to help people to memorize and also helo them to find or link questions, give hints want people could ask
- good presentation has a lot of questions, right? help people to ask question. a thank you won't guide people or push people to think about content.

### Slides (technical)

#### Add slide numbers

I do not know how often I experienced this scene of somebody asking a question after the talk: "Please, can you go back to the slide with this graph, not this one, the other, can you go back one slide, no the other direction, ...., the slide with this graph...". Solve this problem with slide numbers: "The question is about slide 8"

#### Check colors (using a projector in a bright room)

You want to present the performance of your algorithm and compare it to several other algorithms. Unfortunately, the line of your algorithm is not visible in the graph as you chose orange for your algorithm. Quite embarrassing, but happens quite often.

- It is very important to test your color theme and contrast in the environment in which you are going to present
- If this is not possible, try to check it on a (bad) projector in a very bright room.
- Increase the brightness of your screen and monitor the change of contrast of your colors.

Does anyone know a good website to check colors automatically?

#### Font size of 30pt
