# 101 Presenations

I gave a lot of feedback to student presentations during my time working at the university but also later, whenever I had the chance in my professional environment. A lot of the feedback contained similar topics, so recently I decided to start writing it down in this "open for edits" repository. Feel free to drop a pull request including a change or additional content.

Slide numbers |  I do not know how often I experienced this scene of somebody asking a question after the talk: "Please, can you go back to the slide with this graph, not this one, the other, can you go back one slide, no the other direction, ...., the slide with this graph...". Solve this problem with slide numbers: "The question is about slide 8" |  
Check colors (on a projector) | It is very important to test your color theme and contrast in the environment in which you are going to present. If this is not possible, try to check it on a projector in a very bright room. In general try to avoid bright colors such as yellow as it might not be visible when using a projector. | Any good website to check colors automatically?
